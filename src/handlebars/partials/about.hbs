    Hi, I'm Ben: a software engineer with 3 years of experience building massive
    scale web applications that power the largest advertising system in the
    world.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    I'm also a coding bootcamp grad, former theatre major, and halfway decent
    guitarist.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    My experience spans the stack, focusing on single page apps. I've spent my
    time at Google building and leading frontend projects in Greentea, the
    tailor-made CRM that underlies Google's sales team.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    Since joining Google, I've been:
    <br />
    <br />
    <ul class="bulleted">
      <li>
        Selected as one of ~40 engineers responsible for code health of Dart
        across Google
      </li>
      <li>
        Given ownership of the proprietary configuration language that powers
        every chart and table in Google Ads and Greentea
      </li>
      <li>
        Relied on as a leader for my team: guiding architecture, establishing
        best practices, reviewing designs, and onboarding new team members
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    I've experienced tons of growth since my start, evolving into a team lead
    with a keen eye for UX and product that puts the user first. Projects I lead
    are: consumer quality, on-time, comprehensively tested, and ready for new
    features.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    I'm always gearing up for my next challenge.
